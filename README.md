# Regularization_in_Linear_Regression
:

🏷️ Lasso Regularization (L1): Helps with feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero, which simplifies the model and focuses on the most significant features.

🏷️ Ridge Regularization (L2): Reduces the magnitude of coefficients, preventing overfitting while keeping all features in play, ensuring the model doesn't get too complex.

💡 Why Regularization Matters: By introducing a penalty on large coefficients, these techniques enable models to perform better on unseen data, making them more reliable and robust, especially with datasets containing many features.
